* What Is It

=Orga= is a flexible org-mode syntax parser. It parses org content into AST ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][Abstract Syntax Tree üå≤]]). And it's written in JavaScript.

* Why
org-mode is simply a superior format than other more popular ones, but it's mostly trapped inside of emacs. It's so good that it was the #1 reason to learn and use emacs for a lot of people (me included). But it's too good to not share with the rest of the world. If it can run in JavaScript, it can run on anything.

* Example

#+begin_src org-mode
,* hello +world+.

This is a org-mode content.

,#+begin_src javascript
console.log('nested!')
,#+end_src
#+end_src

* Compatible Eco-systems
It integrates natively with popular tools.

The =orga= parser is completely compatible with unified. Which means you get to take advantage of the works of others put into the pipeline.
